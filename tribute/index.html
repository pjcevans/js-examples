<h3>Inventer of the first compiler for a computer programming language</h3>

<p>Hopper was one of those rare visionaries who could understand the potential of something well before her peers.</p>

<p>As well as being an inspiring individual Grace Hopper made the progress she did despite living in a time period plagued by patriarchal inequality. Hopper succeded in an industry, which still suffers from a lack of diversity in places, that was accustomed to the success of men - exemplified by her being awarded the inaugural Data Processing Management Association <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Information_Technology_Professionals"><em>Man</em> of the Year award</a> </p>

<p>Hopper also excelled in <em>another</em> industry at that time dominated by the opposite gender by becoming a <span><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/US-O7_insignia.svg/24px-US-O7_insignia.svg.png"></span> Rear admiral in the United States Navy</p>

  <p class="mb-0">"The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, 'Do you think we can do this?' I say, "Try it." And I back 'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't forget to take chances."</p>
